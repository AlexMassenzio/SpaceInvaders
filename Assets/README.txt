Unique Mechanic: Press fire a second time to detonate your shot! You can take out multiple targets at once with it, but it requires a bit of timing.

To edit game variables, as well as create multiple sets of settings to try out, go to the ScriptableObjects folder. In there, you can edit the current settings, or create a new set by RightClick -> Create -> WaveSettings/PlayerSettings

Currently, the game locally saves the play count. If there was more time, I could create an editor script that can load the local data and let the developer see all stats.
